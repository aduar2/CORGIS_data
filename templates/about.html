    <h1>About the Skyscraper Data</h1>

<p>The data used in this web app is from CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/skyscrapers/">here</a>.
    The data contains statistics about tall buildings around the globe constructed from 1895 to 2020, with some years missing.

</p>
    
    <p>One of the statistics reported is the tallest building constructed each year.
         
        Not all of the buildings are "skyscrapers", but they are all tall buildings. 
        This data set contains data about buildings with heights ranging from ___m to _____m
        Since not every year from 1895 to 2020 had a building completed, some years are not availiable to select. Some buildings in this data 
        set were given a height of 0 becuase an official height for the building was unavailable. This also disqualified a few years and
        buildings from appearing on the list or _____ tallest.
        When you select a year, all of the buildings that were comptleted that year are compared in height, and then the tallest is returned.
