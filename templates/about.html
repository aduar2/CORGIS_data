    <h1>About the Skyscraper Data</h1>

<p>The data used in this web app is from CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/skyscrapers/">here</a>.
    The data contains statistics about tall buildings around the globe constructed from 1895 to 2020, with some years missing.
    The heights of all the buildings in this data set are in meters. One more sentence.
    
</p>
    
<p>One of the statistics reported is the tallest building constructed each year.
         
    Not all of the buildings are "skyscrapers", but they are all tall buildings. 
    This data set contains data about buildings with heights ranging from ___m to _____m.
    Since not every year from 1895 to 2020 had a building completed, some years are not available to select. Some buildings in this data 
    set were given a height of 0 becuase the site the data is from (<a href="http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/">http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/</a> 
    did not have an official height for a building. This also disqualified a few years and
    buildings from appearing on the list or _____ tallest. or at worst, 
    When you select a year, all of the buildings that were comptleted that year are compared in height, and then the tallest is returned.
    
</p>
<p></p>

<p>There are three more statistics shown with graphs. 
Becuase many buildings do not have year, the data in the graphs over years are quite innacurate. </p>
